Tạo ssh key tại window
copy file id_rsa.pub tới folder .ssh của user bằng lệnh:
	scp "C:\Users\long.trinh-tien\.ssh\id_rsa.pub" long.trinh-tien@192.168.2.25:~/.ssh
Vào folder .ssh, copy file "id_rsa.pub" thành "authorized_keys" : cat id_rsa.pub >> authorized_keys
Cấp full quyền user cho authorized_keys: chmod 700 ~/.ssh && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (700 cũng được)
Xóa id_rsa.pub


*Với linux thì dùng ssh-copy-id

*thêm nhiều key vào thì dùng >> chèn thêm(https://gist.github.com/otkrsk/b0ffd4018e8a79b9010c461af298471e)
Step 1: Generate first ssh key Type the following command to generate your first public and private key on a local workstation. Next provide the required input or accept the defaults. Please do not change the filename and directory location.

workstation 1 $ ssh-keygen -t rsa
Finally, copy your public key to your remote server using scp

workstation 1 $ scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@remote.server.com:.ssh/authorized_keys
Step 2: Generate next/multiple ssh key

Login to 2nd workstation
Download original the authorized_keys file from remote server using scp:
workstation 2 $ scp user@remote.server.com:.ssh/authorized_keys ~/.ssh
Now create the new pub/private key:
workstation 2 $ ssh-keygen -t rsa
Now you have new public key. APPEND this key to the downloaded authorized_keys file using cat command:
workstation 2 $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Finally upload authorized_keys to remote server again:
workstation 2 $ scp ~/.ssh/authorized_keys user@remote.server.com:.ssh/
You can repeat step 2 for each user or workstations for remote server.

Step 3: Test your setup Now try to login from Workstation 1, 2 and so on to remote server. You should not be asked for a password:

workstation 1 $ ssh user@remote.server.com
workstation 2 $ ssh user@remote.server.com
